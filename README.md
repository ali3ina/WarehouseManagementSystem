# Warehouse Management System (WMS)

## Overview

This repository houses the code and documentation for a comprehensive Warehouse Management System (WMS) implemented in Java. The system facilitates the management of warehouse operations, including order processing, inventory tracking, and client communication. The project is structured into two main components: WarehouseClient for client interaction and the WMS module for processing orders and managing warehouse activities.

## Project Structure

- **WarehouseClient:**
  - Contains the Java code for the client application.
  - Facilitates order submission and communication with the WMS server.

- **WMS:**
  - Holds the core functionality of the Warehouse Management System.
  - Utilizes an HTTP server for communication and order processing.
  - Incorporates various design patterns to enhance the project's scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Features

- **Order Processing:**
  - WarehouseClient initiates order requests.
  - WMS processes orders efficiently, updating inventory and order status.

- **HTTP Server:**
  - The WMS module employs an HTTP server for seamless communication with clients.
  - Endpoints are defined to handle order requests, inventory queries, and other relevant functionalities.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - The project incorporates design patterns such as Factory Pattern, Observer Pattern, and Strategy Pattern to enhance code structure and maintainability.

## How to Run

1. **WarehouseClient:**
   - Run the WarehouseClient application to initiate order requests.
   - Ensure proper network connectivity for communication with the WMS server.

2. **WMS:**
   - Open the WMS module and run the HTTP server.
   - Define appropriate configurations for the server, such as port and endpoints.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Factory Pattern:**
  - Implemented for creating various types of orders in a flexible and extensible manner.

- **Observer Pattern:**
  - Used to notify clients about order processing updates, providing a real-time view of the order status.

- **Strategy Pattern:**
  - Employed for defining different strategies for order processing based on order type and priority.

## Project Scale

Given the complexity and size of the project, consider the following folders and files:

- **Documentation:**
  - Contains detailed documentation explaining the system architecture, design patterns used, and guidelines for future development.

- **Libraries:**
  - Includes any external libraries or dependencies used in the project.

- **Tests:**
  - Holds unit tests and integration tests to ensure the robustness of the system.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance scalability for handling a larger number of orders and warehouse items.
- Implement additional features such as reporting, analytics, and user management.

## Conclusion

The Warehouse Management System is a sophisticated project designed to streamline warehouse operations. Its modular structure, design patterns, and HTTP server integration make it a robust solution for managing warehouse activities efficiently.

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, and provide feedback for continuous improvement!

**Note:** Due to the project's complexity, it is recommended to refer to the detailed documentation provided in the "Documentation" folder for a deeper understanding of the system architecture and design choices.
